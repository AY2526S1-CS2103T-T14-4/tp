* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
    * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
    * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called ElderRing) used for managing elderly client information.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named ElderRing because it aims to help Silver Generation Ambassadors form a “ring of care” around elderly clients by consolidating important details such as contact information, family details, medical notes, and schedules.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ElderRing Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t14-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
